Our data analysis pipelines have been designed wit re-usability in mind. As such, there's patterns to follow in setting up the analysis for most of the experimental needs, and in these series of documents we will describe the process of doing some of the most common tasks.

1. [Experiments' Structure](./ExperimentsStructure.md)
2. [Pre-Process](./PreProcess.md)
   1. Paths
   2. Spatial Aggregation
   3. Genetic Aggregation
   4. Pre-Process
